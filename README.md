1. Install Python from microsoft store 
   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-38/9mssztt1n39l
2. Use Proxy Gen and make HTTP proxies.
3. Run Setup.bat
4. Run Run.bat
   
PS: it is normal when there are bunch of question marks at the begining
    and do not forget to renew the proxies


   Have fun :)
